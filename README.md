# CS224n: *NLP with Deep Learning*

This repository contains my solutions to programming assignments of Stanford CS224n. The course provides a thorough introduction
to cutting-edge research in deep learning applied to *Natural Language Processing*. the topics include:

* Word Vector Representations
* Window-based Neural Networks
* Recurrent Neural Networks
* Long-Short-Term-Memory Models (LSTM)
* Recursive Neural Networks
* Convolutional Neural Networks
